In this directory you can find some patches that change/customize
the features of the menu system.
Patches are placed here when the integration of them in the base code
would require the introduction of many configuration parameters
and/or would burden the maintenance of the package.
This does not mean that they are not valuable pieces of code: they are
here just because in my opinion they deserve inclusion in the official
release.

Please also note that they could have not been tested as deeply as the
unpatched code has been, and that they could also be not working on some
browsers supported by the unpatched code.

Feel free to contact the contributors of these patches and/or me
for discussions and suggestions.

You can find some other patches in the "Patches" section of the
phplayersmenu project on sourceforge:
