#Basic Setup Notes for small tournament#

##Minimal Setup##

1. Computer to act as the server
1. Wireless Router that has sufficient range to cover the server.  It isn't required that the router connect to the internet.  The router should be isolated from other network users.  So if the Archery range has an existing network that is publicly available, it is advisable to have a second network that all of the scoring traffic is on.  The server isn't secure (may be possible, but isn't out of the box) and anyone on the network could adjust scores.
1. Ethernet cable to connect the server to the router.  Wireless would also be possible, but the cable should be more reliable.
1. Android tablets with chargers.  There needs to be at least one table per target bale.  The system allows the number of archers per bale to be adjusted. 
1. Arrow proof tablet guard
1. I projector or TV that can be used to project the scores. This TV/Projector should connect to a computer on the network.  This could be the server if required, but it is better to have a second machine running the TV Output so that you don't need to project the edits and setup that is required to conduct the tournament.


##Recommended Setup##
1. Second computer to run the TV Output.
1. Video Extension cables (HDMI, DVI, or VGA) required to connect the display to the server.
1. Additional computers to allow for Score verifications.
